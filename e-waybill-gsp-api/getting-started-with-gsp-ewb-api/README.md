# Getting Started with EWB GSP API

This document describes the steps to integrate with ClearTax GSP for E-waybills.

## Integration Steps

**1. Create a sandbox account** - For testing, it is recommended to always use the sandbox environment. For host, SSL and more information on the sandbox environment, [click here](../e-waybill-gsp-api-reference.md#sandbox-environment).

**2. Complete sandbox testing** - Test all the APIs on the sandbox environment. For more information on the API documentation, [click here](../e-waybill-gsp-api-reference.md#api-documentation).

**3. Create a production account** - Once the testing is successful, create a ClearTax production account. For host, SSL and more information on the production environment, [click here](../e-waybill-gsp-api-reference.md#production-environment).

**4. Register GSP in NIC** - Before making any changes to production, you need to register ClearTax as GSP in NIC. [Check how to register](how-to-register-gsp-on-nic.md). Note the username and password created at this step. You will need them later when using the Authentication API.

**5. Go live**!
