# E-Invoicing FTP Magnet

![](../.gitbook/assets/ftp-magnet-banner.png)

FTP Magnet is a middleware application between your FTP server and ClearTax E-Invoicing application. You can export data from your ERP to your own FTP server. As a part of on-boarding, ClearTax configures itâ€™s FTP Magnet to connect to your FTP server. The FTP Magnet reads the input files from your FTP server and uploads them to ClearTax E-Invoicing application. Once the uploaded files are processed, it writes the response back to your FTP server.
