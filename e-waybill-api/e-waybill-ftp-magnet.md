FTP Magnet is a middleware application between your FTP server and ClearTax E-Waybill application. You can export data from your ERP to your own FTP server. As a part of on-boarding, ClearTax configures itâ€™s FTP Magnet to connect to your FTP server. The FTP Magnet reads the input files from your FTP server and uploads them to the ClearTax E-Waybill application.
